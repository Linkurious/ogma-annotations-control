# Events

In order to react to user interactions and changes in the annotations, the controller emits events. You can listen to these events to perform custom actions.

It allows you to hook into the annotation lifecycle, such as when an annotation is created, updated, selected, or deleted.

Also history-related events are emitted when undoing or redoing changes. It would allow you to notify your UI when the if user can undo or redo an action.
